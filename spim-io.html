<h2>CS 366 - First SPIM Programming Assignment</h2>

Due: Monday, February 2, 2004 at 11:59 pm
<p>
For this assignment, we will decode three different values 
from a integer value received from input.  The decoding
is done based on the following information:
</p><ul>
<li>The first 7 bits of the original value will
be used to store an ASCII character value in the numeric range from
0 to 127.  The "first 7 bits are the seven least significant bits
at positions 6 through 0.

</li><li>The next 5 bits (position 11 through 7) of the original value will
be used to store a signed integered value in the range from -16 to
+15.  Treat these bits as a signed 5-bit integer value using two's
complement representation. 
If the bits are all zeros, the decoded value will be zero.
If these bits are all ones, the decoded value will be -1.
If these bits are "01111", the decoded value will be +15.
If these bits are "10000", the decoded value will be -16.

</li><li>The next 6 bits (position 17 through 12) of the original value will be used
to store a integer value in the range from 0 to 63.  
Treat these bits as an unsigned 6-bit integer value.
If these bits are all zeros, the decoded value will be zero.
If these bits are all ones, the decoded value will be 63.

</li><li>Bits 30 through 18 are not used with the decoding, so the values of 
these bits do not matter.

</li><li>The most significant bit (position 31) is used to stop the execution
of the program.
</li></ul>
<p>
Your program is to first print out your name, netid (user id on icarus)
and your CS account user id.  This will help identify you for grading.
Your program is to prompt the user to enter in the integer input.
If a negative integer is entered, print some appropriate message and quit 
the program. 
For a non-negative integer input, print a message that clearly showing the 
three decoded values.
When printing the ASCII character value, print out the actual character 
when possible.
If the character is a non-printable character, print out a message stating 
the character is
non-printable and print out the numeric value of the ASCII character.
Your program is to continue prompting, reading and decoding integer 
values until a negative value is entered (i.e loop back to the statement
where you prompt for input).  
</p><p>
The programs will be graded based on how they execute on <b>xspim running in 
the CS Department computers</b>.  You are to submit your program electronically 
using the the <b>turnin</b> command with the project name of <b>mp1</b>.
Your program must be well commented and use blank
lines to separate logical sections of your code.

</p><h2>Input and Output in SPIM</h2>
I/O is done in SPIM using the <b>syscall</b> opcode.  For 
each I/O operation, a specific value is placed in the $2 register
(also referred to as $v0).  Depending on the I/O operation to be
performed, other registers may be involved.  The following table
lists the possible <b>syscall</b> services.

<table border="1">
<tbody><tr><th>Service</th><th>System Call Code<br>placed in $2/$v0</th><th>Arguments
	</th><th>Results
</th></tr><tr><td>print_int</td><td>1</td><td>$a0 = integer</td><td>
</td></tr><tr><td>print_float</td><td>2</td><td>$f12 = float</td><td>
</td></tr><tr><td>print_double</td><td>3</td><td>$f12 = double</td><td>
</td></tr><tr><td>print_string</td><td>4</td><td>$a0 = address of string</td><td>
</td></tr><tr><td>read_int</td><td>5</td><td></td><td>integer (in $v0)
</td></tr><tr><td>read_float</td><td>6</td><td></td><td>float (in $f0)
</td></tr><tr><td>read_double</td><td>7</td><td></td><td>double (in $f0)
</td></tr><tr><td>read_string</td><td>8</td><td>$a0 = address of string buffer<br>
			  $a1 = length of string buffer</td><td>
</td></tr><tr><td>sbrk</td><td>9</td><td>$a0 = amount</td><td>address (in $v0)
</td></tr><tr><td>exit</td><td>10</td><td></td><td>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<ul>
<li>The print_string service expects the address to start a null-terminated
character string.  The directive <b>.asciiz</b> creates a null-terminated
character string.
</li><li>The read_int, read_float  and read_double services read an
entire line of input up to and including the newline character.
</li><li>The read_string service has the same semantices as the C
library routine <i>fgets()</i>.
<ul>
<li>It reads up to n-1 characters into a buffer and terminates the string
with a null character.
</li><li>If fewer than n-1 characters are in the current line, it reads up to 
and including the newline and terminates the string with a null character.
</li></ul>
</li><li>The sbrk service returns the address to a block of memory containing
n additional bytes.  This would be used for dynamic memory allocation.
</li><li>The exit service stops a program from running.
</li></ul>

The following special characters are used with character strings
in SPIM.  The special characters follow the C language convention:
