Introduction
------------

In this lab, you will be exploring pattern searching within text
This lab is divided into three parts - the first involves implementing
the KMP algorithm, while the second is an implementation and simple application of tries.
The third is an involved extension to the second part

Please find both the problems in folder part1 and part2 and part3.

Read

- kmp/kmp.cpp          (practice)
- trie/trie.h          (practice)
- autocomplete/trie.h  (optional)


Only part1 is for attendance submission. Other parts are for you to
